# VR-Fashion-Show_Basic

Virtual reality (VR) offers a new medium for marketing communications, where consumers are immersed into technologically synthesized real-use experiences of products and services.
Virtual Reality in the field of marketing can bring a lot of changes in sales and purchases. VR marketing allows companies to bridge the gap between experience and action. 
One can use VR to offer a digital experience in place of a physical one, which can promote products and services. In this project we find how customers engage 
themselves in VR/VR 360 Environment Simulations (Fashion Show in our case). Using ZMET technique, the work focused on three themes like VR as democratization, 
VR as embodied escapism, and VR as actualized anxiety. Analysis was further carried out in a hermeneutic approach that explains the experiential gestalt.
